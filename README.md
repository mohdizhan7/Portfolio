# Izhan Portfolio

Apple‑style, animated portfolio built with **React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion** and deployed with **GitHub Pages**.

## Run locally
```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repo and push this project to a branch named `main`.
2. In _Settings → Pages_, set **Build and deployment** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` — the included workflow builds and publishes automatically.
4. Your site URL will appear in the Actions run log, and in **Settings → Pages**.

The Vite `base` is set automatically for project pages using the workflow environment.
